## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project visualizes the *Breadth-First Search (BFS)* algorithm in a graph with a ring topology.

### âœ¨ Users can dynamically:
- âž• Add or remove nodes
- ðŸ”— Connect nodes via edges
- â–¶ Execute and visualize BFS traversal from a selected source to destination

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- ðŸŽ¨ *JavaFX GUI* with custom layout and UI control
- ðŸ”„ Circular layout for ring topology
- ðŸ–± Interactive graph manipulation (add/remove nodes, connect/disconnect edges)
- ðŸ“ˆ Real-time BFS traversal animation with color-coded paths
- ðŸ–¥ Console log of traversal steps

## ðŸ’¡ Requirements
- â˜• Java 17+ version
- ðŸ“¦ JavaFX SDK
- ðŸ›  IDE (IntelliJ or Eclipse)
## ðŸš€ *How to Run*

- âš™ Set up *JavaFX* in your IDE.
- ðŸ“„ We have two Java classes in this project â€” one by the name of *Main.java, in which our main code is available, while the second one is **Main1.java, which is only for creating the **JAR (executable)* file.
- ðŸ”§ After setting up the library as JavaFX and compiling the code, create the *JAR* file.
- ðŸ–± After this, double-click on the *JAR* file, and you can see the GUI of the project.
